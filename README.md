**README.md**: is a intro about my project. This include the structure of this repository.

**1.-Sampling**

**2.-Metabolomics**: This is an analysis of metabolites measured with a gas chromatograph spectrum mass (GC-SM). Data from html files were loaded into tables that were subsequently calculated for their relative abundance. The values between samples were compared from a barplot, ANOVA and finally a PCA analysis was made with the final metabolites.

**3.-Genomics**: It is a genomic analysis from samples product of a GBS sequencing, ipyRAD was used to assemble de novo, VCFTools and plink to make more specific filters. The relationship was calculated, multiple SNPs were discarded in the same loci, a Mantel test, PCA and admixture were performed and the Heterocity was calculated.

**4.-Transcriptomics**: This is a transcriptomic analysis from samples sequenced with RNAseq. Samples were cut(Timmomatic) and mapped (BWA) to a reference transcriptome. Sequence counting was carried out through command lines in Rstudio that subsequently allowed the evaluation of differential expression between samples. From the counting table, a volcanoplot was performed to exemplify the overexpressed and underexpressed genes.
